What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialise a repository, it defines the folder as the parent directory
of the repository and creates a metadata ".Git" folder to contain all of the
information about the commits in the repository. If the repository is not
initialised, it's not a repository (at least in the specific sense).

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

Staging area is temporary and only holds files/changes that have not yet been
committed. This is useful because otherwise each change would have to be
instantly committed with no fine control over which files/changes to commit.
