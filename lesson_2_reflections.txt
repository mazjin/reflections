What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialise a repository, it defines the folder as the parent directory
of the repository and creates a metadata ".Git" folder to contain all of the
information about the commits in the repository. If the repository is not
initialised, it's not a repository (at least in the specific sense).
