When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Having a remote repository allows other people access to the repo so that many people can work on the project, whether 
forking off to create a new version or contributing to the repo. Additionally, keeping all work local essentially means that if your local machine breaks or loses the data, it's gone forever, whereas with a remote repo you have a backup.
